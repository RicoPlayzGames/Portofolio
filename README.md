# TO DO LIST

Updating Projects and contacts: Updating Projects to the more current projects.
Updating Contacts to more profesional style and adding contacts.
Unique Background: Using Three.js to add physics and 3D rain in background and make it interact with stuff like project cards, text and mouse. Using physics to make the rain realistic and make it go down to the edges of text to continue falling

Adding links to websites made by me: Adding links to some websites being used at that time such as: in store navigation application, GearRev Ignition Crew+, Dropshipping website and possibly more.

# Ideas
Speech recognition: If u say: "Go to contacts" it will go to the contacts section.
